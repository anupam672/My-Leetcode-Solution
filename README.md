# My-Leetcode-Solutions

This repository contains my *initial C++ solutions* to various LeetCode problems.  
Each solution file includes:
- 🧠 My *first approach* (which I may optimize later)
- ✍ A brief *self-written explanation* of the problem
- 🔗 A *link to the original LeetCode problem* (in comments)

### 🚫 Why Problem Statements Are Not Included

To fully respect [LeetCode’s Terms of Use](https://leetcode.com/terms/),  
I have *not copied* any official problem statements or examples directly.

Instead:
- I’ve written a short summary and example *in my own words*
- I’ve added the *LeetCode link* in the comments at the top of each file
- Anyone can *copy-paste the link into a browser* to view the full problem

---

### 🔍 File Format Example

Each .cpp file starts like this:

```cpp
// problem number.title
// Leetcode link  of problem

/*
A brief *self-written explanation* of the problem
*/

🏁 Why This Repository?
